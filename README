  1. About Hyenae NG

  Hyenae NG (Next Generation) is a re-write of the original Hyenae tool which
  was originally published back in the year 2010.

  Besides switching from C to C++, using modern design concepts, Hyenae NG was
  (just like the original Hyenae) written with maximum portability in mind.
  Since the original Hyenae had a very complex command line syntax Hyenae NG
  comes with a fast and intuitively usable command line menu that will allow
  you to effectively set up even complex stress-tests or attacks scenarios
  within seconds.

 2. Basic Usage

 Once you start Hyenae NG, it will enter the main menu state. From here you can
 set up your desired output, generator and dispatcher configuration.

   2.1 Output Setup
 
   The output setup let you choose from several different output option. You can
   either have Hyenae NG's output ignore by selecting "No Output" our you can
   have it send to either a file or a network adapter. Once you have selected
   an output, you can enter it's sub setup by selecting it again by either
   entering it's menu item number again or by simply pressing enter. Outputs
   that have a sub-setup are marked with a (...) once they are selected.

   2.2 Generator Setup

   The generator setup let you chose from several different generators. Most
   generators feature a payload option for which you can select another
   generator and so on. Since network frame generators are nested in transport
   layers, their available payload generators will differ based on the
   previously chosen frame generator. Here is an example of a typical
   payload nesting for an ethernet packet:

     Ethernet +-> IPv4 +-> TCP
               |       +-> UDP
               |
               +-> IPv6 +-> TCP
                        +-> UPD

   2.3 Dispatcher Setup

   The dispatcher setup will let you set up the actual data dispatcher. You can
   define stop-limits or configure a fixed or random send delay in order to
   break flood detection mechanisms on your target system.

   2.4 Start Dispatcher

   Once you have set a generator, you can choose this option to start up the
   dispatcher and start sending packets. If you haven't set a generator yet, 
   an error message will be shown instead. The dispatcher will operate until
   either a stop-limit (if set) is reached or the user presses any key. After
   the dispatcher has stopped you can either return to the main menu by entering
   0 or start it again by either entering 1 or simply pressing enter.
